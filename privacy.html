                <h4>1. Your Security Is Our Top Priority</h4>
                <p>
                    At PayBuddy, we understand that trusting an online platform with your financial information is a big
                    decision.
                    That's why we've made security the core of everything we do. From the moment you log in to the time
                    your bill is paid, every interaction is protected by industry-standard security protocols.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="mb-4">
                <h4>2. Bank-Level Encryption in Action</h4>
                <p>
                    All payment transactions on our platform are encrypted using 256-bit SSL (Secure Socket Layer)
                    encryption—the same level used by major banks around the world. This means that your data is
                    unreadable to anyone except the system processing it. Whether you're paying your electricity bill or
                    renewing your subscription, your data is safe.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="mb-4">
                <h4>3. Verified & Trusted Payment Gateways</h4>
                <p>
                    We work only with certified, PCI-DSS compliant payment gateways that meet the highest industry
                    standards. These platforms undergo regular audits to ensure that your debit/credit card details,
                    UPI, or bank info are handled with utmost care and compliance.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="mb-4">
                <h4>4. Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)</h4>
                <p>
                    To give you an extra layer of protection, we offer two-factor authentication. This means even if
                    someone gets your login credentials, they can’t access your account without a one-time code sent to
                    your phone or email. It's a simple yet powerful way to safeguard your account.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="mb-4">
                <h4>5. Real-Time Transaction Alerts</h4>
                <p>
                    The moment you make a payment, you’ll receive an instant notification via SMS or email. This helps
                    you keep track of every transaction and lets you spot any suspicious activity immediately, so
                    nothing goes unnoticed on your account.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="mb-4">
                <h4>6. No Data Sharing With Third Parties</h4>
                <p>
                    We never sell or share your personal or financial information with advertisers or third-party
                    platforms. Your trust is invaluable, and we guard it fiercely by keeping your data private, secure,
                    and only used to process your bills efficiently.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div>
                <h4>7. Regular Security Audits and Updates</h4>
                <p>
                    Cyber threats evolve daily—and so do we. Our platform undergoes frequent security checks,
                    vulnerability assessments, and software updates to stay ahead of threats. Our in-house security team
                    works round-the-clock to ensure your peace of mind.
